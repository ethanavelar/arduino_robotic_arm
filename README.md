# Arduino Robotic Arm
The goal of this code is to drive a 4-axis desktop size robotic arm. This repository is written specifically for the Arduino Uno. The parts list and SolidWorks files are provided in the Parts List and 3D Printed Components sections respectively.

## Code
Code for this project will be written in the Arduino programming language.

## Wriring Diagrams
Wiring diagrams will be provided here.

## Parts List
A list of the stepper motors and drivers as well as servos will be provided here.

## 3D Printed Components
This section will hold the SolidWorks files for the 3D printed components. Parts are printed using PETG filament for increased strength.
